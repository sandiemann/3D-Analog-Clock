# 3D-Analog-Clock

This project is based on javascript THREE.js libarary. There are two sides of the clock cylinder, one side shows the 'Central European Time' (CET) and the other side shows the 'Indian Standard Time' (IST). The reset key control listener is implemented on 'r' or 'R' key hit.

# Getting Started
